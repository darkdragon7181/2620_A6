Hello out there.  This is a program that allows you to simulate a map using
a binary search tree. Every word in this file will be mapped into the tree.
For example the word Hello has a "signature" of elloH.  elloH becomes the key
and Hello is entered into the vector of strings associated with this signature.
So if two words have the same signature they will be entered into the same
tree node.  So instead of using the STL map we use our own binary search tree.
